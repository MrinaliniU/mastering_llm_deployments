# LLM Deployment Course 

A comprehensive course on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently and cost-effectively.

## 🎯 Course Objectives

- Load and fine-tune pre-trained transformer models
- Apply optimization techniques: distillation, pruning, quantization
- Deploy models using FastAPI, Gradio, Docker, and AWS ECS
- Implement production best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started
